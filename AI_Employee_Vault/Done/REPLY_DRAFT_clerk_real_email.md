Dear Colin,

Thank you for the transparent communication about Clerk's pricing updates. I appreciate the detailed breakdown of the changes and the reasoning behind them.

The improvements are impressive, particularly:
- 5x increase in free tier (10K to 50K Monthly Retained Users)
- Unlimited applications across all plans
- MFA and enhanced authentication now included in Pro Plan

These changes demonstrate a customer-first approach and make Clerk even more competitive in the authentication space.

I'll review the new pricing structure at clerk.com/pricing and evaluate the best plan for my projects. The automatic volume discounts and annual billing options are particularly appealing.

Thank you for giving advance notice about the April migration timeline.

Best regards,
