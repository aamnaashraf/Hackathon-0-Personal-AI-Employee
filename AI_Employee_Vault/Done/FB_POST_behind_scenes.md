🛠️ Behind the scenes of building an AI autonomous employee system...

The challenge: How do you make AI trustworthy enough to handle real business communications?

My solution: The "Draft-Approve-Execute" workflow ✨

Here's how it works:
1️⃣ AI monitors all channels (email, WhatsApp, social media)
2️⃣ AI drafts responses based on context and company guidelines
3️⃣ Human reviews and approves (or edits) the draft
4️⃣ AI executes the approved action
5️⃣ Everything gets logged for audit and learning

Why this matters:
✅ AI handles the heavy lifting (monitoring, drafting, scheduling)
✅ Humans stay in control (final approval on everything)
✅ Best of both worlds: speed + safety

Tech stack: Python, Playwright, Claude AI, MCP servers, Obsidian vault for knowledge management

The result? A system that's fast like automation but smart like a human assistant.
