**Subject**: Re: Payment Information Updated - Services Secured

Dear Render Support Team,

I wanted to confirm that I have successfully updated my payment information on the Render dashboard at https://dashboard.render.com/billing.

The credit card details have been updated and verified. My services (backend-1 and backend) should now continue running without interruption.

Please confirm that the payment method has been processed successfully and that my account is in good standing.

Thank you for the timely notification and for allowing time to update the payment details.

Best regards,
Aamna Ashraf Rajput
