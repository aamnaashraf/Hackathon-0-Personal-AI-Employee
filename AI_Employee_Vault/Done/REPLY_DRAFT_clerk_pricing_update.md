**Subject**: Re: Update to Clerk's pricing - Thank you for the improvements

Dear Colin and the Clerk Team,

Thank you for the comprehensive update on Clerk's new pricing structure. I appreciate the transparency and the clear communication about the changes.

The improvements look very positive, especially:
- Increased free tier to 50,000 Monthly Retained Users
- Unlimited applications across all plans
- Enhanced Authentication features now included in Pro Plan

I'll review the new pricing details at clerk.com/pricing and evaluate which plan best fits my current and future needs. The automatic volume discounts and annual billing options are particularly appealing.

Thank you for continuing to improve Clerk's offerings and for giving advance notice about the migration timeline.

Best regards,
Aamna Ashraf Rajput
