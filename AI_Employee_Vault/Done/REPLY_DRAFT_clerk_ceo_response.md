Dear Colin,

Thank you for the transparent communication about Clerk's pricing changes. I appreciate the detailed explanation and advance notice.

The improvements look excellent, especially the increased free tier (50K users) and inclusion of MFA in the Pro Plan. These changes make Clerk even more competitive.

I'll review the new pricing at clerk.com/pricing and update my plan accordingly before the April deadline.

Best regards,
Aamna Ashraf Rajput
