Dear Aamna,

This is a test email to verify the automated email workflow is working correctly.

The workflow steps are:
1. Draft created in Pending_Approval
2. Reviewed and moved to Approved
3. Moved to Done folder triggers automatic sending

If you receive this email, the system is working perfectly!

Best regards,
AI Email System
