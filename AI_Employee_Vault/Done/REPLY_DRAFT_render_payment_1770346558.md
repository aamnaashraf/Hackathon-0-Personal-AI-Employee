**Subject**: Re: Payment Information Update - Account Action Taken

Dear Render Support Team,

Thank you for the payment notification regarding my account.

I acknowledge receipt of the alert about the unpaid balance and invalid payment information. I will update my credit card details at https://dashboard.render.com/billing within the next 24 hours to ensure uninterrupted service for my applications (backend-1 and backend).

I appreciate the advance notice and will ensure the payment method is updated before the next billing attempt.

Best regards,
Aamna Ashraf Rajput
