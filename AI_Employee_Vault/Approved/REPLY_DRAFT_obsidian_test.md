Dear Aamna,

This is a quick test to verify the Obsidian workflow is working correctly.

If you receive this email, it means:
✓ You moved the file from Approved to Done in Obsidian
✓ The email sender watcher detected the change
✓ Email was sent automatically via SMTP

Workflow is operational!

Best regards,
AI Email System

## Instructions
