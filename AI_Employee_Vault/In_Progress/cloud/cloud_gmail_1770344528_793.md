by Thomas Thorsell-Arntsen Imagine this for a moment. You’re working on a new digital product. The experience feels right early. Everyone agrees on the flow. Decisions stick. There’s less friction between design and development. Fewer misunderstandings. Fewer rewrites. Progress feels calm. You’re still moving fast, but not recklessly. And most importantly, what you build actually resembles what you imagined. This is what vibecoding looks like when it’s done properly. And yes, it’s something you can learn. Feel the vibe (for real this time) Vibe-coding has moved quickly from curiosity to capability. Instead of starting with technical constraints, teams begin with experience. What the user sees. How they move through a product. What decisions they make along the way. Platforms like Lovable make this tangible by enabling teams to design, test, and iterate on real user experiences quickly. Not wireframes. Not isolated user flows. Actual, usable products. The result is faster learning, better alignment, and earlier validation, especially when designers, product managers, and developers work together instead of in sequence. A sneak peek under the hood of wallogo.com From vibe to structure: how Wallogo was built At SmplCo, vibecoding isn’t an experiment. It’s how products ship. A good example is Wallogo, built by Andreas Melvaer and Bjørn Ivar Knudsen . The approach is deliberately experience-first. The team builds the user experience in Lovable without worrying about integrations or production concerns. The goal is flow, not perfection. They iterate quickly, often rebuilding the experience several times. When the experience feels right, the LLM is asked to formalise it. For example, the team might prompt: “We’re happy with the user experience we’ve designed. Based on this flow, propose an industry-standard database schema, describe the key user journeys step by step, and visualise the system relationships in a Mermaid diagram.” It’s mad, the code snipped and the diagram is the same thing: a mermaid diagram, a simple way for LLMs and othe computers to understand diagrams. The resulting structure is then reviewed, challenged and validated. Only after that are development phases defined and the product connected to real infrastructure such as databases, payments and user management. Central prompts are treated as intellectual property. They are stored securely. What you see in wallogo.com started exactly this way. Gettogive won the She Build buildathon by Lovable Vibecoding with purpose: the Get To Give story Vibecoding isn’t just about speed. In the hands of designers like Line Hjartarson, it becomes a way to protect intent while moving fast. Line, a winner of Lovable’s She Builds initiative, used vibecoding to bring Get To Give to life. A values-driven product designed to help children experience generosity in a meaningful way. This wasn’t something that could be specified correctly upfront. Tone, emotion and interaction had to be explored before structure followed. Vibecoding made that possible without losing control. A custom CMS built in Lovable for Gettogive for the She Builds Buildathon Practical lessons from vibecoding in the real world Vibecoding works best when treated as a discipline. A few hard-earned lessons stand out. LLMs are not great at long, messy iteration. If you keep patching the same project, quality often degrades. It’s usually smarter to stop, step back, and restructure. Use planning modes early. Having a rough idea of structure, roles and flows before you start saves significant pain later. Don’t be afraid to scrap your project. Ask your vibecoder to summarise what works, extract the good parts, and turn them into a clean, structured prompt. Then start again in a blank project. Never underestimate the importance of having a crystal-clear vision of what you want to build. Vibecoding accelerates intent. If the intent is fuzzy, the output will be too. Structure matters more than most people think. Changing visuals is easy. Changing data models and core assumptions is not. Anyone can code, but judgment still matters One of the most important shifts vibecoding enables is who gets to participate. According to Line Hjartarson, we don’t need more people memorising syntax. We need more people who understand problems, users, and outcomes. AI lowers the technical barrier. Human judgment remains essential. The fundamentals will matter more in the future. You need to understand what's going on. About the Lovable bootcamp The Lovable bootcamp focuses on designing experiences that AI can reason about, writing clear, scalable prompts, understanding when to trust AI and when not to, and moving from idea to working product without losing control. It is taught by practitioners who use these workflows daily. You learn by doing. You make mistakes early. You build intuition, not just outputs. A new baseline for modern teams Vibecoding is not a trend. It is a new baseline. Teams that learn these workflows early will move faster, with less friction and fewer false starts. Not because they cut corners. But because they design before they commit.
