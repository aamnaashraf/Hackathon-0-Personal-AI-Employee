This is Colin Sidoti, co-founder and CEO of Clerk.
 
Today, we’re excited to share our first major pricing update since November 2023. As our products have evolved over the years,
we’ve heard that our pricing no longer felt quite right. This update reflects the feedback, frustrations, and suggestions we’ve
heard from many of you.
 
Our goal is simple: make authentication essentials more affordable, while focusing our fees on differentiated features and areas
with real operational cost.
 
Let’s dive into some specifics.


The vast majority of customers will pay less, or receive more features for the same price

We’re improving affordability across nearly every dimension, so both our smallest and largest customers are set to benefit:
 
 * 50,000 Monthly Retained Users are now free in every application, up from 10,000

 * Unlimited applications are now included in every plan, eliminating the need to upgrade each application individually

 * The Enhanced Authentication Add-on has been eliminated, and most of its features are now included in our Pro Plan (starting
   from $20/mo). This includes:

 * Multi-factor authentication

 * Device tracking and revocation

 * Satellite domains

 * Simultaneous sessions

 * 5 impersonations per month are now free, to allow trying the feature before purchasing the Enhanced Administration Add-on

 * Automatic volume discounts will now be applied as usage grows

 * Annual billing is now available for an additional discount

 
Alongside these changes, we’ve also reduced the complexity of our plans to ensure you’re never surprised by which features are
included or omitted.


Some customers will see price increases

We’re making three changes that will increase costs for a minority of our customers. Those changes are:
 
 1. Using four or more Clerk Dashboard seats now requires a Business Plan (starting from $250/mo).
    We love building a dashboard that goes beyond authentication and helps teams operate and scale their business. This change
    will allow us to continue improving the dashboard for more teammates in more roles.

 1. Enterprise Connections (SAML and OIDC) are now metered within the Pro Plan, instead of unlimited under the former Enhanced
    Authentication Add-on.
    Under the new pricing, applications with three or more Enterprise Connections will see increased costs. These costs will
    support continued investment in Enterprise Connections, including our upcoming support for SCIM and self-serve configuration.

 1. Access to SOC 2 and HIPAA artifacts now requires a Business Plan.
    We gate access to audit artifacts because they involve ongoing third-party audits and real operational overhead. Importantly,
    the underlying security controls are the same for all customers, regardless of plan.


Rollout

Our new plans are available starting today, and the full details are available on our updated pricing page
[https://clerk.com/pricing]. We encourage customers to switch as soon as possible.
 
If paid customers do not select a new plan before their billing period beginning in April, Clerk will automatically migrate them
to a new plan. We hope to avoid automatic migrations, though, and will be sending multiple reminders before they occur.
 
If you have any questions or concerns, or if your business requires a custom plan, please don't hesitate to contact us
[https://clerk.com/contact].


Thank you

We love making our pricing even more competitive, and it’s only possible because tens of thousands of customers like you have
entrusted Clerk as their authentication provider.
 
We look forward to the years ahead as we’ll continue to innovate not just on authentication, but all of customer management.
 
Colin Sidoti
